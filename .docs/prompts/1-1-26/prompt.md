Task: Update Shadcn Button Variants based on Figma

Please update the Button component in components/ui/button.tsx to match the design specifications found in the Figma link provided in #cl.

Instructions:

Style Mapping: Follow instructions in #f

State Management: Ensure that hover, active, focus-visible, and disabled states are accurately represented for every variant (Primary, Secondary, Outline, Ghost, etc.).

Consistency Check: If the Figma design requires colors or values not currently defined in tailwinds.config.js or app/globals.css, please list the specific variables I need to add.

Recommendations: If the Figma design is missing a specific state (like a 'loading' or 'pressed' state) that would improve the UX, please suggest and implement a logical styling recommendation based on the existing design system.
