# Tell Me More Content for Each Question

## Question 1: Recognition
**If you could no longer recognise the people you love**

This question helps your loved ones understand what quality of life means to you. For some people, recognising family is essential to finding meaning in life. For others, they feel that life still has value even without this ability.

There's no right or wrong answer—this is deeply personal. Some people choose to write their own statements instead, using their own words to describe what matters most to them.

Examples
- "Being able to recognise my family is what makes life meaningful to me."
- "Even if I can't recognise loved ones, life has value if I can still feel their presence and affection."

## Question 2: Independence
**If you needed total help with eating, washing, and dressing**

This explores how important independence and self-care are to you. Some people feel they could adapt to needing full assistance, while others consider independence essential to their dignity and wellbeing.

Your answer helps your Person Responsible understand your personal boundaries. You can also write your own statement if you prefer.

Examples
- "I value my privacy and independence. I would not want to live if I needed total help with personal care."
- "I could accept help with eating, washing and dressing if I can still spend time in my garden."

## Question 3: Communication
**If you could no longer understand others or express your own thoughts**

Communication means different things to different people. Some feel they could still connect through touch or presence. Others consider the ability to express thoughts and understand others essential to meaningful life.

Many people find it helpful to write their own statement.

Examples
- "It is important for me to be able to communicate in some way, even if I cannot speak."
- "Life has meaning when I can still feel love and connection, even without words."

## Question 4: Eating & Drinking
**If you could no longer eat or drink by mouth and needed a feeding tube**

For many people, sharing meals and the experience of eating and drinking are deeply meaningful. This question helps your care team understand how you feel about tube feeding if you can no longer eat naturally.

There's no right answer. Some people would want to continue living with a feeding tube, others would not. You can also express this in your own words if that feels more comfortable.

Examples
- "Sharing meals with my family is one of life's greatest joys. I would not want a feeding tube."
- "Staying alive is worth it to me, even if I need to be fed through a tube."

## Question 5: CPR (If your heart stops)
**If you are very sick and not expected to recover, would you want CPR?**

CPR involves forceful chest compressions, electric shocks, breathing tubes, and medications. It works best for otherwise healthy people with sudden cardiac events. For people who are already very frail or not expected to recover, CPR rarely works and can cause broken ribs and other injuries.

This is about choosing between every possible intervention versus allowing a natural death with comfort care. Many people prefer to write a personal statement about their wishes around end-of-life interventions.

Examples:
- "I do not want to struggle to breathe. If I'm not expected to recover, let me die naturally with comfort care."
- "I want every chance to live, even if recovery is unlikely. Attempt CPR."

## Question 6: Life Support (Breathing machines)
**If you are not expected to recover, would you want a machine to breathe for you?**

Mechanical ventilation means a tube in your throat connected to a machine that breathes for you. If you're not expected to recover, this could prolong your life but not improve your condition.

Some people want every chance to live, even temporarily. Others prefer to let nature take its course with comfort measures only. You can express your wishes using the options provided or write your own statement.

Examples:
- "I do not want to be kept alive on a breathing machine if there's no hope of recovery."
- "I would want a ventilator if it gives me time to say goodbye to my family, even briefly."

## Question 7: Medical Treatments
**If you are not expected to recover, would you want antibiotics or heart medications?**

When recovery isn't expected, treatments like antibiotics or heart medications might prolong life but won't change the overall outcome. Some people want all available treatments, while others prefer to focus on comfort only.

This question helps doctors know whether to provide life-prolonging treatments or focus entirely on keeping you comfortable and pain-free. As with all questions, you can write your own statement using your own words if you prefer.

Examples:
- "I do not want to be in pain. Just focus on my comfort, not prolonging my life."
- "Keep treating infections and supporting my body for as long as possible."

## General Note for All Questions

**Writing Your Own Statements:**

The NSW Health Advance Care Directive allows you to write your own statements in Section 2 using your own words. There is no right or wrong way to express what matters to you. Some example statements from the official form include:

- "I do not want to struggle to breathe"
- "I do not want to be in pain"
- "Life has meaning when I can enjoy nature and when I can practise my faith"
- "I would like to stay at home as long as it is not too hard on my family"

These questions are designed to guide your thinking, but you're always free to express your wishes in the way that feels most authentic to you.
