NSW Advance Care Directive: Final Content
1. WELCOME & CONTEXT
Page: Introduction
Heading: Plan ahead for your healthcare Body: An Advance Care Directive lets you share what matters to you about medical care, in case you’re ever seriously ill and can’t communicate. It helps the people who care about you make decisions you’d be comfortable with. Optional expand: "What is this document?"

In NSW, this is a legal document that healthcare providers must follow. You can change it anytime. It only applies when you can’t make decisions yourself.

2. VALUES & WHAT MATTERS
Page: Introduction to this section
Heading: Reflecting on your care

Body: 
In the next few steps, consider what feels right for you in different health scenarios. Think of this as drawing a map for your loved ones and doctors, showing them where your boundaries lie.

These answers help ensure your voice is heard. They define your personal standards for dignity and comfort, helping your care team understand which choices align with your values.

3. MEDICAL PREFERENCES
Page: CPR (The Heart)
Heading: If your heart stops Context: CPR can include forceful chest pumping, electric shocks, and breathing tubes. It works best for healthy people, but less well for those who are already very frail. Question: If you are very sick and not expected to recover, would you want CPR?

[ ] I’m not sure. I’d need to know the specific situation.

Page: Medical Treatments
Heading: Infections and Medications Question: If you are not expected to recover, would you want antibiotics or heart medications to prolong your life?

[ ] It depends. Some medications yes, others no.
